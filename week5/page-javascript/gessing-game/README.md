# the initial design breif
let imaginyour boss have given you the following breif in creating this game
i want you to crete a simple "geuss the number" type game 
it should chose   a random number between 1 and 100 an challenge trhe player to guess the number between 10 turn  fter ech turn theplayer should be told if they are wrignh or wrong it should also tell the player if they are 
upon looking t this breif the first thing we can do is to strt breakingit into ctionble task in as much 

1.  Generate a random number between 1 and 100
2.  record the turn number the playerthe player is on
3.  providthe player with  way to guess the number
4.  once  a guess has been submited first recod it somewher so the palayer cnsee theirprevious guesses
5.  chex the correct number
6.  once it is the correct number :
    -disply congratulation message
    -stop the player frombeing able to enter more guess(this will mess the gme up)
    -disply control allowing the restart the game
7.  if it is wrong and theplayer has turns left:
    -tell the player they are wrong and whether their geuss was two high or too low 
    -allow them to enter anothe guess
    -increment the turn number by 1
8.  if it is wrong and the plyerhas no turn left:
    - tell the player game of over

    -display control allowing the player to restart the game
9.  once the game restart,mke sure the game logic and ui are copletly  reset
